        <H1>Dual Boot Linux Mint and Windows 11</H1>
        <p>I recently purchased a new Windows 11 desktop with the intention of creating a partition of the hard drive and installing Linux Mint.  
            My goal is for Linux Mint to be my "daily driver".</p>

        <p>I have watched more YouTube videos on the subject than I care to admit, but here are the two I found most helpful.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>How to Partition/Prepare your Hard Drive to Dual-Boot Linux</li>

                <li>How to Dual Boot Ubuntu and Windows 10</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Success!!!!</h2>
        <h3>What is next?</h3>
        <p>I do not plan to go hard core open source.</p>

        <p>As many applications can be ran through the browser, I downloaded Microsoft Edge on both operating systems and setup browser favorites which sync between Windows and Mint.</p>
            
        <p>I plan to use Office 365/Google Suite through the browser for my email and office products. Although to save my sanity, I will definitely pop back into the Windows side and use the native Excel app if I have to do some serious Excel data manipulation.</p>  
            
        <p>I also plan to work my way through this course: <em>Operating System-Crash Course for Beginners</em></p>
            
        <p>That is all for now...reboot -p</p>
