            <h2>Dual Boot Linux Mint and Windows 11</h2>
                <p>I recently purchased a new Windows 11 desktop with the intention of creating a partition of the hard drive and installing Linux Mint.  
                    My goal is for Linux Mint to be my "daily driver".</p>

                <p>I have watched more YouTube videos on the subject than I care to admit, but here are the two I found most helpful.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gS5SoogltE" target="_blank">How to Partition/Prepare your Hard Drive to Dual-Boot Linux</a></li>

                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXxTxBPKecQ&list=WL&index=14&t=776s" target="_blank">Dual Boot Ubuntu and Windows 10</a></li>
                    </ul>
                
                <h3>Success!!!!</h3>
                <h4>What is next?</h4>
                <p>I do not plan to go hard core open source.</p>

                <p>As many applications can be ran through the browser, I downloaded Microsoft Edge and Firefox on both operating systems and setup browser favorites which sync between Windows and Mint.</p>
                    
                <p>I plan to use Office 365/Google Suite through the browser for my email and office products. Although to save my sanity, I will definitely pop back into the Windows side and use the native Excel app if I have to do some serious Excel data manipulation.</p>  
                    
                <p>I also plan to work my way through this course: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROjZy1WbCIA&list=WL&index=5" target="_blank">Linux Operating Systme: Crash Course for Beginners</a></p>
                    
                <p>That is all for now...reboot -p</p>

            <h4><i>One of my first Linux adventure in 2020</i></h4>
                <p>I obtained an old Windows laptop from my daughter.  It was her gaming laptop, so I thought it had potential</p>
                <p>It was running incredibly slow and was shutting down for my daughter for no reason.  I am excited to see whal I can do with it...to play...to get my nerd on.</p>
                <P>I decided to install Ubuntu and to make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y4p0aTundE" target="_blank">video</a> of me doing so.</P>
