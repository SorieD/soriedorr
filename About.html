        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p>I live in North Carolina with my husband of 31 years and our cat Hazel.  Six years ago, we purchased a little land, half of which is wooded, and have been enjoying the peace and quite of rural America. </p>

        <p>Currently I work part time as a nurse.  I have been a nurse for 31 years.  Half at the bedside and half as a Corporate Educator.  After I retired/quit my full time job, I decided to go back to the bedside.</p>
            
        <p>Hobbies, wells let's just say I like to keep busy. I plan to share my hobbies with you on this site.</p>
